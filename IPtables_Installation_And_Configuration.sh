# We have one of our websites up and running on our Nautilus infrastructure in Stratos DC. 
# Our security team has raised a concern that right now Apacheâ€™s port i.e 6200 is open 
# for all since there is no firewall installed on these hosts. So we have decided to add 
# some security layer for these hosts and after discussions and recommendations we have come up with the following requirements:

#     Install iptables and all its dependencies on each app host.

#     Block incoming port 6200 on all apps for everyone except for LBR host.

#     Make sure the rules remain, even after system reboot.
